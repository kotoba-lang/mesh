  "ADR-2607082400 step 3 — the murakumo -> cljc-node HTTP contract.

  A reference (not fleet-deployed) mesh node: boots a plain JDK
  `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` (no new dependency -- this repo's
  existing modules already favour zero/minimal deps, e.g. `kotoba.wasm-exec`
  pulls in only Chicory) exposing the SAME url shape kotoba-server's own
  mesh routes use (`GET /health`, `POST /mesh/http/<route>`), so an operator
  or murakumo doesn't need to know which runtime answered a request.

  This is the strangler-fig target ADR-2607082400 designed: existing
  production mesh apps stay on Rust kotoba-server unchanged; a NEW capacity
  substrate for `.kotoba`-ported apps (see `mesh_drama_profile.kotoba`) can
  run here instead, with murakumo (or any operator) driving it over plain
  HTTP -- no gossipsub/libp2p needed, since murakumo already knows every
  node from its own `fleet.edn` (ADR-2607071900 already established
  murakumo as the fleet's de facto centralized placement authority).

  Deliberately NOT deployed to any fleet node by this commit -- it's the
  reference contract + a local, tested proof it works end-to-end, not a
  production rollout (that is its own, separately-scoped follow-up)."

  POLICY attached under :kotoba.mesh-node/policy for `dispatch` to enforce
  at run time). Throws if the static safe-subset/capability check
  (`kotoba.runtime/check`) or the binary emission didn't succeed -- a route
  this node can't actually serve safely is a startup-time configuration
  error, not a per-request one.

  `check` MUST run before `wasm-binary`: `wasm-binary`'s own `_policy`
  argument is not itself a guard (it never rejects an unsafe/ungranted
  program), so a caller that skipped `check` would get a compiled module
  with none of the denylist/capability-policy/affine-capability static
  checks applied to it."

  a real deployment would inject a shared/persistent store instead of a
  fresh atom per dispatch (follow-up, out of this ADR's scope).

  Both `instantiate` and `kgraph-host-functions` are called with WASM's
  :kotoba.mesh-node/policy (set by `compile-route`), which routes every
  kgraph-* host import through the same fail-closed, per-call capability
  guard (`kotoba.wasm-exec/guard-host-call`) the interpreter and `wasm run`
  CLI paths use -- the unguarded 1-arg forms exist only for callers that
