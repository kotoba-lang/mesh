(ns kotoba.mesh.kotoba-oracle
  "Runs the shipped decision core.

  `src/kotoba/mesh/route.kotoba` holds the HTTP contract;
  `resources/mesh/oracle/route.kir.edn` is what was compiled from it and what
  ships. This namespace is the seam, and it is deliberately thin: it resolves a
  resource, executes an export, and decides nothing.

  ## Why this exists

  ADR-2608112100: a `.kotoba` core with a parity test is not migrated. The
  measure is not how many host lines went away, it is whether the AUTHORITY
  moved -- and two implementations bound by a test are still two
  implementations, with the host's copy being the one that runs. So there is no
  `route.cljc` twin here. `kotoba.mesh.node/handler` asks this seam what a
  request is and what status its outcome gets, and keeps only the halves that
  are not decisions: looking up a table, running a guest, writing bytes to a
  socket.

  ## What is NOT a core here

  `examples/*.kotoba` are guest PAYLOADS, not decision cores. A mesh node
  compiles operator-supplied `.kotoba` routes at startup and serves them --
  that is the product, and `compile-route` says so. Precompiling one into a
  shipped artifact would defeat the thing this repository is for. They stay
  where they are, compiled fresh by `compile-route`, and this seam does not
  know about them.

  ## No fallback around a missing artifact

  A missing or unreadable artifact throws. It does not quietly run something
  else, because a silent fallback is how a decision stops being the one that
  shipped. Which path runs is decided by the DATA a caller has, never by
  whether the artifact loaded.

  ## ClojureScript hosts must register the KIR

  There is no classpath to read a resource from, so `register-kir!` is the only
  way in and `kir` throws without it. Today this repository has no
  ClojureScript consumer -- `kotoba.mesh.node` is bound to
  `com.sun.net.httpserver` and Chicory and could not be one -- so the narrowing
  is stated ahead of a consumer rather than discovered by one."
